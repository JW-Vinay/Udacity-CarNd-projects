    "The code for this step is contained in the code cell number 3 & 4 of the IPython notebook (vehicle_detection). I basically used skimage.feature.hog to extract hog features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images (code cell 3).  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",

    "\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like for parameter combinations and then used that to sort of identify the final parameter values I would be using. The code for this can be seen in cell number 303. Here's an example below that simply visualized the hog features for random vehicle & non vehcile images. I used the following hog parameters `orientations=11`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)` and grayscaled image\n",

    "####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a function called `find_cars()` based on the lectures that computes the hog features, color & spatial features and then makes predictions. It then uses the scales, cells_per_block and window size to define bounding box for each positive detection. The function is available in code cell 261.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a sliding window approach I sub-sampled hog features to get all overlaying windows. I initally tested with a single scale of 1.5, but noticed it did not detect cars on all images. Hence I went with a multi-scale approach and experimented with random scales before zeroing on 1.0, 1.5 & 1.7 as my 3 scales. I tried higher scale values of 2.0, 3.5 etc. and greater realized that with these y_ranges it was not detecting all the cars. The current ones chosen detect multiple overlapping boxes, but its better than missing out on information. I then played with different Y_range values to match up with these scales to finally create a pipeline that uses 5 different y_ranges along with these scales. I experimented with `cells_per_block=1` which was causing many false positives and overlaps and hence setlled on `cells_per_block=2`which gives the right amount of overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `find_cars()` function I used a window size of 64. I experimented with random higher values but settled on 64 since it was giving enough information and I din't want to increase the size of the bounding box further.\n",

This heatmap is then thresholded to return only hot parts of the image minus the false positives(where a vehicle is detected). We then apply the `scipy.ndimage.measurements.labels()` function to count all features in an image. It sort of groups nonzero pixels belonging to a car togther to return tuple with no of cars detected. I then invoke `draw_labeled_bboxes()` to render the labeled boxes on to the copy of the image. The function basically iterate through the labels array and pixels with each car_number label value. We then form bouding box around nonzerox and nonzeroy values using min and max values.\n",

    "I faced issues with identifying the ideal scales & y range values. I had to spend a lot of time experiementing with values across different frames of images before zeroing on the 3 scale values and yranges. I also wasn't sure about the colorspace to use. I first tried HSV & RGB and I found the classifier accuracy on the lower side so I ended up trying YCrCb which seemed to work perfectly fine. All this experiementation took quite some time.\n",
