**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

    1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.
    * My pipeline basically consists of the following steps:
        1. GrayScale: Used the helper function to get a grayscaled version of the image.
        2. Gaussian Smoothing:  use the Open Cv Gaussian Blur func to filter out the noise that may affect the next steps.
        3. Canny Edge Detection: Use the algorithm (helper function using Open CV) to detect edges in the image using the low & high thresholds specified.
        4. Identify Region of Interest: Basically apply a polygon mask (shape of polygon defined by the vertices array - quadrilateral in this case) on the edge detected image to retain only interested edges (the left & right lane lines) & black out the rest.
        5. Hough Transform: This is used to convert image to hough space and detect all the line segments in our region of interest.
        6 Draw lines: Next draw the line segments from hough transfrom on a blank image similar to the original image. This is an important step and these are the following sub-steps done before drawing it.
            * First identify the min & max value of the Y interecept for the lane lines. The max value will be the y-intercept/y-coordinate of the image shape. image.shape[0]. The min value will be the min value of the y coordinate among all the line segments.
            * Partition the line segments based on their slope. Slopes less than 0 would be on left side & greater than 0 would be on the right side. Additionally a slope threshold (0.3) on either side of O to filter out outlier segments from the list.
            * compute the mean of the left segments & the right segments.
            * Use the above computed left & right segment mean vectors (x1,y1,x2,y2) to compute the mean left & right slopes.
            * To draw the lines we need x1, x2 y1,y2 coordinates for the left & right lines. The y1 & y2 values will be ymin & ymax computed above. x1 & x2 coordinates can be computed using the line equation: (y-y1) = m(x-x1). Substitute  m=slope mean, y = ymin & ymax  (x1,y1) = mean of line segments computed above. Using this equation of the line we have coordinates x1,y1,x2,y2 for each line and we can draw it using openCv on the blank image.
       7. blend the blank image with lines with the original image before any processing using openCv.addWeighted Func to produce an annotated image (original image with lane lines annotated).

    2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline
        1. The draw function takes a mean of valid line segments. This can be an issue when data points are less as variance can be large.
        2. Also the lines drawn do seem smooth enough as they do not use any context of prior images/frames.
        3. With no context of prior frames there is no prediction of upcoming frames and hence lines can be abrupt.
        4. Canny may also fail if there isn't enough contrast between the lane lines & the road if there is a shadow. Really an issue with the grayscaling actually.

    3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

        1. The draw lines function could instead maybe use median and deviation from median to identify outliers.
        2. Storing the last N line segments and using that to compute the mean might smoothen the lines & make it more accurate.
        3. Try using HSV space to detect lane lines better.
